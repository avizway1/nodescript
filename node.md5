Certainly! Below are the steps in capital letters along with the bash commands for creating an MD5 file:

STEP 1: ADD REQUIRED REPO FROM OFFICIAL NODEJS WEBSITE.

```bash
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
```

STEP 2: INSTALL NODEJS.

```bash
sudo yum install -y nodejs
```

STEP 3: VERIFY INSTALLED VERSION.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

STEP 4: CREATE A server.js FILE AND RUN IT.

Create a file named `server.js` with the provided content.

```bash
echo "YOUR_SERVER_JS_CONTENT" > server.js
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_JS_CONTENT` with the content of your `server.js` file.

STEP 5: INSTALL REQUIRED PACKAGES / INSTALL DEPENDENCIES.

```bash
npm install
```

STEP 6: NODE.JS WILL INTERPRET AND EXECUTE THE CODE IN THE server.js FILE. THIS IS A COMMON PATTERN FOR RUNNING SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT APPLICATIONS.

```bash
node server.js
```

After following these steps, your Node.js server should be up and running. Make sure to replace `YOUR_SERVER_JS_CONTENT` with the actual content of your `server.js` file.
